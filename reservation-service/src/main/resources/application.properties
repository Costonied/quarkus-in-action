# Security configuration
#
# For simplicity's sake, in this case, we didn't make the authentication mandatory
# (we did that in the Users service),
# so there are no quarkus.http.auth.permission.* properties.
# We develop the Reservation service in a way that allows anonymous access.
# If there is no Authorization header on incoming requests,
# they will be allowed to go through, but the security context will be empty.
# Thanks to this simplification, you can still call the service's REST endpoints
# without obtaining and passing an authentication token.
#
# means that the application is a set of RESTful HTTP resources,
# so the preferred authentication method is the use of the Authorization HTTP header, rather than a browser cookie
